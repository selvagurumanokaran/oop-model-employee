A company has a set of employees. Model the system using OOP principles. 
The following are the requirements:
1. Every employee has the following attributes,
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Sex
    * Role
    * Salary
    * A manager
    
   In addition, every developer may know one or more programming languages.
   
   Every consultant will oversee one or more geographical locations.
   
   The manager will have one or more team members who are reporting to him/her. 
2. Employee could be developer, manager or consultant.
3. Every employee reports to a manager except CEO.
4. There is a base salary for every employee. If an employee is developer and he knows C++ language, 
    the employee gets additional $200. Likewise, if a consultant manages AP region, the consultant gets $300 more.
